# CSC680-FinalProject - Exercise Tracker App
- Introduction:

When i was asked to think of a app i thought that could be improved i immeditaly thought of Google's and Samsungs health app. As their apps can be annoying to use as someone that just wants to log in their exercises, calorie intake, sleep schedule, etc. Since to log in values for each of those tables, we have to go through so many screens and it can be tedious at times. The overall desgin of the apps seems to be based on smartwatches and phones, where they would draw in data from them on when you are exercising, moving, sleeping, etc, and then calucalte the values for the tables. This is something i didnt like, as my smartwatch wasnt always accurate on when i was working out, or it would log in false data that i would need to delete or change. 

So with this in mind, i wanted to create a app that is for a user to log in data and view data easier and with less hassle. A more bare bones app, with less frills like recommended sleep cycle or reminders to workout.
